# Android Debug Bridge Package Manager
[![Auto build](https://github.com/DKorablin/Plugin.AdbPackageManager/actions/workflows/release.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/DKorablin/Plugin.AdbPackageManager/actions)

UI plugin for working with Android Debug Bridge (ADB) with extended package management and inspection features.

## Key Features

- List installed packages on connected devices
- Install / uninstall / update APK packages
- View APK internal structure (resources, manifest, certificates)
- Extract / export APKs from device
- Open / close APK in dedicated viewer plugin
- Multi-target build: .NET Framework 3.5 and .NET 8
- Designed as SAL.Flatbed plugin

## Requirements

- Android SDK Platform Tools (adb available in PATH)
- .NET Framework 3.5 (legacy target) or .NET 8 (modern target)
- Windows OS (for net8.0-windows target)

## Installation

1. Download the release archive (.zip or .nupkg).
2. Place the plugin assembly into the host application plugin directory (SAL / host supporting Windows environment):
	- [Flatbed.Dialog](https://dkorablin.github.io/Flatbed-Dialog/)
	- [Flatbed.Dialog (Lite)](https://dkorablin.github.io/Flatbed-Dialog-Lite)
	- [Flatbed.MDI](https://dkorablin.github.io/Flatbed-MDI)
	- [Flatbed.MDI (Avalon)](https://dkorablin.github.io/Flatbed-MDI-Avalon)
3. Restart the host application; Plugin.AdbPackageManager should appear in the plugin list.

## Usage

1. Ensure a device is connected and visible via `adb devices`.
2. Load the plugin inside the host application.
3. Use the UI to:
	- Refresh package list
	- Install / uninstall APK files
	- Open an APK to inspect its contents (delegates to APK viewer plugin)
4. Close APK when finished to release resources.

## Related Plugin Integration

This plugin calls another plugin [APK Image View](https://github.com/DKorablin/Plugin.ApkImageView) by ID to open/close APK files. Ensure the viewer plugin with ID `ca0bd89a-318f-4fa3-9a5e-49b3e1358a53` is present if you want file inspection features.

## Building

- Multi-target configuration is defined in the project file.
- Restore packages then build:
	- Visual Studio: regular Build
	- CLI: `dotnet build` (net8 target) and MSBuild for .NET Framework if needed.

## Logging & Diagnostics

Errors (e.g., missing required plugins) are traced via `PluginWindows.Trace`.
Use debug output / tracing listeners to capture runtime diagnostics.

## Disclaimer

ADB must be installed separately. This project does not bundle Android platform tools.
